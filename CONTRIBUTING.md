So you want to contribute? That's great! Please follow the guidelines below. It will make it easier to get merged in.

Before implementing a new feature, please submit a ticket to discuss what you intend to do. Your feature might
already be in the works, or an alternative implementation might have already been discussed.

Do not commit to master in your fork. Provide a clean branch without merge commits. Every pull request should have its
own topic branch. In this way, every additional adjustments to the original pull request might be done easily, and
squashed with `git rebase -i`. The updated branch will be visible in the same pull request, so there will be no need to
open new pull requests when there are changes to be applied.

Ensure that proper testing is included. To run `ram` tests you simply have to be in the project's root directory and
run:

```bash
$ make test
```
